# Classification of Sandwich Types: A Set-Theoretic Analysis

**Abstract** - This paper provides a set-theoretic analysis of the relationships between cheeseburgers, hamburgers, and double hamburgers, offering a comprehensive understanding of their categorization in the context of culinary classification. We examine the subsets and intersections of these sandwich types based on their ingredients and patty counts, emphasizing the variability in their classification under different culinary viewpoints.
